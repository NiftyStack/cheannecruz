Design research is foundational to creating products, services, and systems that respond to human needs. It is a crucial step in creating optimal user experience. It allows you to understand complex human behavior and turn that into actionable insights to improve your design.

  * What are their pain-points or problems they are facing?
  * How will they use your product or service?
